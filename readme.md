# AI-Powered Food Waste Management â€” Synthetic Dataset
deployed link: https://realistic-synthetic-inventory-dataset-for-food-waste-predictio.streamlit.app/
## Overview

This dataset simulates **8,000 daily inventory records** for food businesses â€”
restaurants, supermarkets, cafeterias, and cloud kitchens â€” collected over a
**one-year period (Jan 1 â€“ Dec 31, 2025)**. Each row represents one
business/food-category's inventory activity for a single day: how much was
purchased, how much was sold, what was left over, and how much of that
leftover stock was ultimately wasted.

The data is **fully synthetic** but built from an explicit causal model
(demand â†’ purchasing â†’ sales â†’ remaining stock â†’ waste â†’ waste severity)
rather than independently randomized columns, so it behaves like real
operational data: correlated, occasionally messy, and internally consistent.

- **Rows:** 8,000
- **Columns:** 16 (15 features + ID)
- **Time span:** 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31
- **Target variable:** `Waste_Level` (Low / Medium / High)

## Feature Descriptions

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Inventory_ID` | string | Unique record ID (e.g. `INV000001`). |
| `Date` | date | Day the record was collected. |
| `Business_Type` | categorical | Restaurant, Supermarket, Cafeteria, Cloud Kitchen. |
| `Food_Category` | categorical | Fruits, Vegetables, Dairy, Bakery, Meat, Prepared Food. |
| `Purchase_Quantity` | integer | Units purchased/stocked that day. |
| `Units_Sold` | integer | Units sold that day (always â‰¤ `Purchase_Quantity`). |
| `Remaining_Stock` | integer | `Purchase_Quantity âˆ’ Units_Sold`. |
| `Shelf_Life_Days` | float | Days before expiry; depends on `Food_Category`. |
| `Storage_Temperature` | float | Storage temp (Â°C); depends on `Food_Category`. |
| `Daily_Demand` | float | Realized customer demand that day. |
| `Promotion` | Yes/No | Whether a promotion ran that day. |
| `Weather` | categorical | Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Hot. |
| `Waste_Quantity` | integer | Units wasted (always â‰¤ `Remaining_Stock`). |
| `Waste_Reason` | categorical | Expired, Overproduction, Low Demand, Storage Issue, or No Waste. |
| `Donation_Made` | Yes/No | Whether surplus (non-expired) food was donated. |
| `Waste_Level` | categorical (target) | Low / Medium / High severity of waste for the record. |

## How the Data Was Generated (Business Logic)

The generator (`generate_dataset.py`) builds each row through a causal
pipeline instead of sampling columns independently:

1. **Category drives shelf life & storage temperature.** Prepared Food and
   Bakery have short shelf lives; Dairy and Meat need cold storage; Bakery
   and Prepared Food are stored warm.
2. **Purchasing happens *before* the day's weather is known.** `Purchase_Quantity`
   is based on a forecast of expected demand (business size + *planned*
   promotions), with realistic over-ordering noise â€” but it cannot react to
   weather, since orders are placed in advance.
3. **Realized demand reacts to weather and promotions on the day itself.**
   `Daily_Demand` and `Units_Sold` are scaled down on rainy days (lower
   footfall) and scaled up on hot/sunny days and promotion days â€” and
   promotions are modeled to *outperform* their forecast, so promoted days
   sell through more completely and waste less.
4. **Waste is driven by shelf life, storage temperature, and sell-through.**
   Short shelf life, high storage temperature (relative to the category's
   ideal), and a low sell-through rate (lots of `Remaining_Stock` relative to
   `Purchase_Quantity`) all increase `Waste_Quantity`.
5. **Waste_Reason** is chosen as the dominant driver behind each wasted
   batch (expiry risk, over-ordering, weak demand, or poor storage), so it
   is explainable from the other columns rather than random.
6. **Donation_Made** is more likely when waste is larger *and* the batch
   wasn't already expired (i.e., the food was still safe to give away).
7. **Waste_Level** (the target) is derived from the waste-to-purchase ratio,
   calibrated so the dataset lands close to the requested **Low â‰ˆ 55% /
   Medium â‰ˆ 30% / High â‰ˆ 15%** split (actual: 54.1% / 30.0% / 15.9%), with
   ~3% random label noise added so classes are realistic, not perfectly
   separable.

**Business rules enforced everywhere (validated with assertions in the
generator):**
- `Units_Sold` never exceeds `Purchase_Quantity`.
- `Waste_Quantity` never exceeds `Remaining_Stock`.
- No negative inventory values; `Shelf_Life_Days` is always â‰¥ 1.

## Data Quality / Realism

- **Missing values (~2â€“3%)** injected into `Shelf_Life_Days`,
  `Storage_Temperature`, `Daily_Demand`, `Weather`, and `Donation_Made` â€”
  simulating incomplete data entry. Missingness is applied *after* all
  business rules are computed, so it never breaks internal consistency.
- **~1% outliers** in `Purchase_Quantity` (2.5Ã—â€“4.5Ã— normal order size),
  simulating bulk orders, festival stocking, or data-entry errors.
- **Noise** is layered into demand, purchasing, and waste calculations so
  relationships are strong but not perfectly deterministic â€” models will
  need to learn real signal, not just invert a formula.
- **Balanced categories:** all 4 business types and 6 food categories are
  represented in reasonable, non-trivial proportions.

## Assumptions Used

- Purchasing decisions are made **before** the day's weather is known;
  promotions, by contrast, are planned ahead but tend to outperform the
  original forecast.
- "Ideal" storage temperature is category-specific (e.g. ~2Â°C for Meat,
  ~22Â°C for Bakery); waste risk increases only when a batch is stored
  *warmer* than that ideal, not colder.
- Food that is wasted for reasons other than expiry (overproduction, low
  demand, storage issues) is more likely to still be donation-eligible than
  food that expired.
- `Waste_Level` is a **relative** measure (waste as a share of what was
  purchased), not a raw unit count, so a small cafÃ© and a large supermarket
  are judged on the same scale.

## Suggested ML Use Cases

- **Classification:** Predict `Waste_Level` (Low/Medium/High) from
  operational features.
- **Regression:** Predict `Waste_Quantity` directly.
- **Demand Forecasting:** Predict `Daily_Demand` or `Units_Sold` from
  business type, weather, promotion, and category.
- **Inventory Optimization:** Explore how `Purchase_Quantity` decisions
  affect `Remaining_Stock` and downstream waste.
- **Expiry Prediction:** Model relationships between `Shelf_Life_Days`,
  `Storage_Temperature`, and `Waste_Reason == "Expired"`.
- **Sustainability Analysis / EDA:** Waste trends by business type, food
  category, weather, and season; donation-rate analysis.
- **Feature Engineering practice:** e.g. sell-through rate
  (`Units_Sold / Purchase_Quantity`), waste ratio
  (`Waste_Quantity / Purchase_Quantity`), day-of-week/season from `Date`.
